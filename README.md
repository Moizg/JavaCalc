# JavaCalc

🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 💡 I've been working on a sleek and efficient desktop calculator app using Java, and I'm thrilled with the results. 🖥️ But this isn't just any calculator – it's packed with features that make everyday calculations a breeze, and it's all powered by SQL Server for seamless history tracking. 📊

🔍 But here's the real game-changer: the integration with SQL Server allows users to store and retrieve their calculation history effortlessly. Whether you're analyzing trends, reviewing past calculations, or just keeping track of your work, it's all at your fingertips. 💡

🛠️ Built with Java and leveraging the power of SQL Server, this project has been a fantastic opportunity to flex my coding skills and delve into database management. Along the way, I encountered challenges, found creative solutions, and learned valuable lessons that will undoubtedly shape my future projects. 📝

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Java calculator application.
- `JDBCConnection/`: Contains database connector and database-related functionality.
